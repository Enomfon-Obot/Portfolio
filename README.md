# Learning portfolio
I'm a data scientist who's actively expanding my skills and experience in the field. With a strong foundation in Python, R, and SQL, I'm continuously developing my expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

My journey includes both academic training through my MSc in Data Science and practical application in professional settings. I've worked on projects involving predictive modeling, data analysis for business decisions, and developing automated solutions.

What sets me apart is my eagerness to learn new technologies and methodologies, combined with my ability to collaborate across teams to deliver data-driven solutions. I approach each new challenge as an opportunity to broaden my skillset and deepen my understanding of how data science can solve real-world problems.

I'm particularly interested in applying my evolving capabilities to industries undergoing digital transformation, where data insights can drive meaningful change. As I continue to grow in this field, I'm focused on building more sophisticated models, improving my data storytelling abilities, and expanding my technical toolkit.

My goal is to develop into a well-rounded data scientist who can not only analyze complex datasets but also translate those insights into actionable business strategies that deliver measurable value.
